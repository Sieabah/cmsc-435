/**
 * Assignment 3 - csidell1
 *
 * I know this is a piss poor assignment to turn in. I have midterms
 * 	and other work I need to get through and openGL 2 isn't worth
 * 	my time to learn as it's been obsolete for 15 years.
 *
 * My resource list goes from the openGL man pages, stack overflow(numerous times),
 * 	lecture slides, lecture resources (UMD dave mount)
 * 
 * Additionally I added a wireframe mode to see how it was built you can toggle with w.
